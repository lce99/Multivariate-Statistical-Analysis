# Multivariate Statistical Analysis: Speed Dating Experiment

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a speed dating dataset from Kaggle to uncover factors influencing dating preferences and decisions. We use multivariate regression analysis and MANOVA to explore gender differences in mate selection and self-perception.

## Data Source
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and encompasses data from speed dating events organized by Columbia Business School professors.

## Methodology
1. **Multivariate Regression Analysis**: Identifying variables that influence the success of matches in speed dating.
2. **MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance)**: Assessing gender differences in self-perception and their impact on dating choices.

## Data Preprocessing
- Variable selection and removal based on relevance and completeness.
- Standardization and normalization of data for consistency.

## Results
- Detailed findings on how various factors like personal interests, self-perception, and gender roles influence dating outcomes.
- Comparative analysis between genders regarding preferences and perceptions in speed dating scenarios.

## Conclusion
Insights into the social dynamics of speed dating, contributing to a broader understanding of social interactions and gender roles.
